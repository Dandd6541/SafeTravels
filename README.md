# Safe Travels

Safe Travels is an application built to help users travel safely with COVID-19 spreading quickly. This app allows a user to add a trip with in-depth descriptions on the traveler's 'Trip'. With that, the traveler can also view the most up to date COVID-19 information for any State and County of their desire. Lastly, as many people travel together, we gave the user the option to add 'travel buddies' for their trips.

## :seedling: Next Steps (Ice Box)

1. Adding an API that will update the data daily, opposed to weekly and also show user's geolocation to know where they're traveling to and from
2. Making the forms on the website more clean and responsive
3. Making it a more social app by adding in an 'Add Friends' feature and seeing their trips (and possibly combining them)
4. Adding in more resources for COVID-19 data in general and for outside the US
5. Add a feature that allows users to see COVID-19 data specifically for the city they're going to WHILE adding trips
