# Safe Travels

Safe Travels is an application built to help users travel safely with COVID-19 spreading quickly. This app allows a user to add a trip within depth descriptions on the travelers Trip. With that the traveler can also view the most up to date COVID-19 information any State and County of their desire. Lastly, as many people travel together, we gave the user the option to add a travel companion.
